        <h2>Hello Again !!</h2>
        <p>There are lots of places to visit in Tura, and if you're looking for one you're in the right place.</p>
        <h3>Tura Peak</h3>
        <img class="img-tp1" src="tp.jpg" alt="Tura-Peak">
        <p>A beautiful and majestic hill stands on the eastern side of Tura at a height of 872 m above sea level 
            overlooking the town of Tura. Local legend has it that the peak provides a sacred shelter or abode to the 
            ‘Gods’ and it is also claimed that Tura was traditionally known as Dura, but due to mispronunciation by the
            British gave it the present name of Tura. The Tura range has been declared a reserve forest with an 
            observatory, a Cinchona plantation and a tourist bungalow located at its vicinity.</p>
        <p>A magnificent view of 
            the lower Brahmaputra valley as well as the golden yellow plains of Bangladesh can be seen all year round 
            from the peak. A foot-track or path developed during the British Raj is still in existence and can be used 
            by tourists and adventurers alike to reach Tura peak with ease and comfort.</p>

        <h3>Nokrek National Park</h3>
        <img class="img-n3" src="n3.jpg" alt="Nokrek National Park">
        <p>About 40 kms, via Asananggiri and Sasatgiri but just 2 kms. from Tura peak; teeming with wild life, 
            Nokrek hill is the home of a very rare species of citrus locally known as Memang Narang orange of the 
            spirits. This Memang Narang is considered to be the most primitive and progenitor of all other varieties 
            of citrus plants in the world with a view to preserve this rare species of citrus indica the first gene 
            sanctuary of the world has been established here.</p>
        <p>The entire Biosphere Reserve is hilly. The rock is mainly gneisses, granulites, migmatites, amphibolites 
            and banded iron formation, intruded by basis and ultra-basic bodies. In most of the Biosphere Reserve area 
            the soil is red loam. But sometimes it varies from clayey to sandy loam. The soils in the Biosphere Reserve 
            are rich in organic matter and nitrogen but deficient in phosphate and potash. The area consists of patchy 
            sedimentary rock composed of pebble bed, sandstone, and carbonaceous shales.</p>
        <p>All important rivers and streams of the Garo Hills region rise from the Nokrek Range, of which the river 
            Simsang, known as Someshwari when it emerges into Bangladesh at Baghmara, is the most prominent.

         <p>Lying at the confluence of Ganol and Rongram rivers, just 9 kms from Tura on the Tura Guwahati road is an 
            ideal picnic spot.</p>

        <h3>Rongbang dare</h3> 
        <p>Is another attractive tourist spot in West Garo Hills which can be easily viewed from Tura-Williamnagar PWD 
            Road and the roadside near Rongbang dare virtually becomes mini bazaar in recent years where the Garos can 
            dispose off their agriculture products besides running their indigenous food and tea stalls.</p>

        <h3>Pelga Falls</h3>
        <p>Pelga falls located at the distance of 7 kms from Tura has become increasingly hot spot for anglers and 
            picnickers in recent years. The tourism department developed this place by constructing a footpath and view 
            point. A typical traditional Garo bamboo bridge constructed over Ganol river is another added attraction.</p>
